# Student-Mark-Prediction-Web-Application
This repository hosts a web application developed with Python and Flask for predicting students' marks based on their study hours. The project integrates a machine learning model trained on a dataset to provide accurate predictions through a user-friendly interface.

Features:

1.Machine Learning Model: 
                        Utilizes scikit-learn for predictive analysis, predicting the percentage of marks based on study hours.

2.Web Interface:  
                Developed using Flask to handle user inputs and display prediction results dynamically.

3.Input Validation: 
                  Ensures users input valid study hours (1 to 24 hours/day) for accurate predictions.

4.Data Logging: 
                  Logs user inputs and predicted outputs to a CSV file for further analysis and tracking.

Technologies Used:

Python, Flask, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, joblib
