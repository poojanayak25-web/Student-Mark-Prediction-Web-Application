# Student-Mark-Prediction-Web-Application
This repository hosts a web application developed with Python and Flask for predicting students' marks based on their study hours. The project integrates a machine learning model trained on a dataset to provide accurate predictions through a user-friendly interface.

Features:

Machine Learning Model: Utilizes scikit-learn for predictive analysis, predicting the percentage of marks based on study hours.

Web Interface: Developed using Flask to handle user inputs and display prediction results dynamically.

Input Validation: Ensures users input valid study hours (1 to 24 hours/day) for accurate predictions.

Data Logging: Logs user inputs and predicted outputs to a CSV file for further analysis and tracking.

Technologies Used:

Python, Flask, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, joblib
